T3 - Tumors greater than 7 cm, or less than 7 cm but with a separate nodule in the same lobe. T3 tumors also include tumors that are less than 7 cm but invade the lining of the lung (pleura), the chest wall, the diaphragm, the main bronchus, or lie within 2 cm of the area where the bronchus divides to travel to the lungs. A tumor is also classified as T3 if it is less than 7 cm but is associated with pneumonia or collapse of the entire lung.

T4 - A tumor of any size, but with another nodule in a different lobe on the same side of the body, or a tumor that invades structures in the chest such as the heart, major blood vessels near the heart, the trachea, the recurrent laryngeal nerve (a nerve near the trachea), the mediastinum (the space between the lungs), the esophagus, or the area where the main bronchus divides to travel to the two lungs.','N','M','Chest');

','NX means that the lymph nodes cannot be assessed (for example, if they were previously removed)
N0 – No cancer cells found in any nearby nodes

Isolated tumour cells (ITCs) are small clusters of cancer cells less than 0.2 mm across, or a single tumour cell, or a cluster of fewer than 200 cells in one area of a lymph node. Lymph nodes containing only isolated tumour cells are not counted as positive lymph nodes

N1 – Cancer cells are in the lymph nodes in the armpit but the nodes are not stuck to surrounding tissues

pN1mi – One or more lymph nodes contain areas of cancer cells called micrometastases that are larger than 0.2mm or contain more than 200 cancer cells but are less than 2mm

    N2b – there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes behind the breast bone (the internal mammary nodes), which have either been seen on a scan or felt by the doctor. There is no evidence of cancer in lymph nodes in the armpit

N3 is divided into 3 groups
